# 📚 BookShelf-EPR
*A small student project for practicing EPR, versioning & basic software development*

---

## Overview
BookShelf-EPR is a **student project** for my software development course.  
Inspired by book apps (like Taaghche), but **just for learning purposes**.  
No real code is copied.
Check the [EPR documentation](EPR.md) for details on project steps, bugs, and releases.


Check the **EPR.md** and **epr_calculations.py** for documentation and simple project calculations.

Goal: understand **project structure, versioning, bug tracking & documentation**.

## Goals
- Write a **simple EPR**  
- Practice **versioning & releases**  
- Track and fix **bugs**  
- Learn about **library responsibility**  
- Build **backend + frontend**  
- Explore **open-source licenses**
